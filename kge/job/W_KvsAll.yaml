  # Amount of label smoothing (disabled when 0) for sp_ and _po queries.
  # Disencourages models to perform extreme predictions (0 or 1).
  #
  # Technically, reduces all labels by fraction given by this value and
  # subsequently increases them by 1.0/num_entities. For example, 0s become
  # 1.0/num_entities and 1s become (1.0-label_smoothing)+1.0/num_entities.
  #
  # This form of label smoothing was used by ConvE
  # ( https://github.com/TimDettmers/ConvE/blob/853d7010a4b569c3d24c9e6eeaf9dc3535d78832/main.py#L156) with a default value of 0.1.
  label_smoothing: 0.0

  # Query types used during training. Here _ indicates the prediction target.
  # For example, sp_ means queries of form (s,p,?): predict all objects for each
  # distinct subject-predicate pair (s,p).
